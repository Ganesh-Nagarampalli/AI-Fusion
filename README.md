## AI-Fusion

- A simple web application that is integrated with AI services to provide a better user experience.

- Currently it is in the development phase and the main goal is to integrate the all the AI services in one place.

- Both the working features use Google Gemini API.

## Current Working Features

- chatBot
- Text Translation

## Link to the Web Application

- [AI-Fusion](https://aifusion.netlify.app/)

## Drawbacks

- Since the application uses free API services, the results are not that efficient.

- The language translation is working fast for well known langauges but for less known languages it is taking time.

- The results of chabot are not arranged in a proper way. So the result looks unstructured.
